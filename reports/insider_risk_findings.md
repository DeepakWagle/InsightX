# Insider Risk - Analytical Finding

## Purpose
This report summarizes insights derived from exploratory analysis of employee communication behavior and psychometric attributes to support responsible insider risk governance.

## Key Findings

- Most employees demonstrate stable and predictable behavior.
- Behavioral and psychometric extremes are uncommon but observable.
- Risk-relevant patterns typically emerge from combined signals, not single indicators.
- Automated or blanket monitoring approaches are likely to generate excessive false positives.

## Recommended Approach

- Use behavioral indicators to prioritize review, not determine outcomes.
- Keep humans central to interpretation and decision-making.
- Integrate behavioral insights with technical, HR, and managerial context.
- Treat all outputs as decision support, not evidence of misconduct.

## Ethical & Operational Considerations

- No employee should be labeled or penalized based on this analysis alone.
- Indicators should be reviewed periodically for bias and drift.
- Transparency and governance are essential to maintain trust.

## Closing Note

This work demonstrates how data can support questions, not definitive answers, in insider risk management.
