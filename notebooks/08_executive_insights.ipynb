    "- The majority of employees are in stable and predictable communication behavior, indicating that broad monitoring approaches are inefficient and unnecessary.\n",

    "- No single behavioral or psychological indicator reliably explains unusual activity; meaningful patterns emerge only when multiple signals are considered together.\n",

    "##### 1. Adopt Human-in-The-Loop Review\n",
    "    Behavioral and psychometric indicators should be used to surface cases for contextual analysis, not automated decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Use Indicators for Prioritization, Not Punishment\n",
    "    Indicators should help allocate analyst attention efficiently rather than trigger enforcement or disciplinary actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Combine Behavioral Insights with Organizational Context\n",
    "    Communication patterns should be reviewed alongside access logs, HR event and manager feedback to avoid misinterpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Avoid Blanket Monitoring Approaches\n",
    "    Since most of the users are in stable behavior, targeted review of outlier patterns is more effective and less intrusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Maintain Ethical and Governance Safeguard \n",
    "    Clear documentation, transparency, and periodic review are essential to prevent misuse and maintain employee trust."
