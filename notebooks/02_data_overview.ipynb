    "**A. Row Meaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the email dataset represents a single email event associated with a user.\n",

    "**B. User Identifiers**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following columns identify the user and system context:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ID – A unique identifier for the email event\n",
    "- User – An anonymized user identifier representing the employee\n",
    "- PC – The workstation or device used to generate the email activity\n",
    "\n",
    "**C. Time Granularity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Date-Time records the timestamp of each email event\n",

    "- Attachment – Indicator of whether the email includes an attachment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Content – Textual or metadata representation of the email body\n",

    "These attributes provide signals related to communication intensity and potential data movement, without implying malicious intent on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Interpretation Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "Email data reflects behavioral patterns, such as frequency, timing, and communication structure. Individual email events should not be interpreted as risky in isolation."

    "- E (Extraversion) – Sociability and assertiveness\n",
    "- A (Agreeableness) – Cooperation and empathy\n",
    "- N (Neuroticism) – Emotional stability and stress sensitivity\n",

    "\n",
