    " - Theft of Intellectual Property occurs when insiders steal sensitive information such as source code, customer data, or trade secrets, typically for personal gain or to benefit a competitor.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Why Insider Threats Are Difficult to Detect:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Insider threats are challenging because insider actions often appear legitimate. Employees use approved devices, valid credentials, and familiar tools, which makes traditional security controls less effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, insider incidents tend to develop gradually. Early behaviors may seem harmless in isolation but become risky when viewed in combination and over time. Human motivations further complicate detection, as emotional and situational factors influence behavior in ways that technical systems alone cannot capture.\n"

    "**Typical Insider Threat Timeline:**\n",
    "\n",

    "Understanding this progression is critical, as early indicators provide the best opportunity for prevention before significant damage occurs."
