# InsightX

InsightX is a business-first exploratory data analysis (EDA) project
designed to extract meaningful behavioral and psychological insights
from large-scale insider threat datasets.

## Objective
To identify early behavioral risk indicators that can support
non-intrusive insider threat monitoring and decision-making.

## Dataset
The project uses the CERT Insider Threat dataset, including:
- Email communication logs
- Psychometric profiles

⚠️ Raw data is not included due to size and sensitivity.

## Approach
- Business and risk problem framing
- Data understanding and quality assessment
- Behavioral and psychometric exploratory analysis
- Insight generation and executive-level reporting

## Scope
This repository focuses on EDA and decision intelligence.
Predictive modeling and automation are intentionally out of scope.

## Ethics & Privacy
All analysis is performed with ethical considerations in mind.
The project does not attempt individual labeling or punitive decisions.

## Status
🚧 Work in progress – Business EDA phase
